		<h2>Virtual Reality Therapy</h2>
		
		<p><strong>Virtual Reality Therapy</strong>, is a new, unique and innovative approach to traditional therapy.  Traditional therapy involves sitting face to face, and communicating with one another.
		Teletherapy has started to become more popular, as well as mobile applications in order to schedule appointments, and even communicate with your therapist.
		<strong>Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy, or VRET for short</strong> is an underutilized type of therapy that is able to treat many different mental health issues 
		such as anxiety, social anxiety, depression, PTSD, as well as certain fears such as spiders, or public speaking.
