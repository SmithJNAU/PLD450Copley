		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		
		 
		<h3> How Does Virtual Reality Therapy, or VRET Work?</h3>
		<p> VRET, or Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy works by exposing the individual to a computer simulated event that recreates the stress, anxiety, or tramua that one has experienced, and suffers from.  
		Now, while this might sound overwhelming, it is down incrementally, with a therapist.  
		They are able to help guide you through it, and teach you coping skills so that your VR experience, can translate to real life events.</p>
		
		<h3>What Does It Cost?</h3>
		<p> Depending on the Provider that you chose, the cost can differ depending on many different factors such as the amount of therapy you need whether on a monthly, or weekly basis.
		We recommend <a href="https://www.xr.health/"> <strong>XR Health</strong> </a> as our service partner because they offer a simple, monthly plan, and the VR equipment is included at no additional cost.
		They also accept most insurances, and HSA Plans.</p>
		
		<h3>Does it Work?</h3>
		<p> VR Therapy is a proven therapy technique that works.  
		However, individual results will vary and some will have quick success, while it may take longer for others.  
		Everyoneâ€™s situation is different, and if you do decide to go ahead with it, you can talk about your concerns with your therapist during evaluation,
		or you can contact them before you decide if it is right for you.</p>

		<h3>Is VR Therapy Like Playing a Video Game?</h3>
		<p> Yes and no.  
		While you may have used a headset for VR gaming before, VR therapy is not a video game.  
		VR therapy uses a 3-D computer-simulated environment that is built specifically for you to address your personal concerns.  
		Different environments include the inside of a car for people who are afraid of driving, to situations that may cause social anxiety.  
		It all depends on the person and the environment can be customized to help you with your treatment.</p>
